This repository houses ideas and suggestions for future ASF infrastructure services, as well as for
enhancements to existing services. 

Have a look in the [Discussions](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-ideas/discussions) tab 
and see if there are ideas your project would want/support. Feel free to add things you would like 
that have not been mentioned yet.

  - Start a new discussion in the category that best matches it:
    - Enhancements
    - General
    - New ideas for services
    - Polls
    - Q&A
  - If you see a suggestion that you agree with, you can upvote it. This helps to demonstrate how broadly the community supports the idea, and that, in turn, could help Infra decide which ideas to devote resources toward implementing.
  - If you want to flesh out a suggestion, feel free to add a comment, a question, a challenge, a tweak to it.
