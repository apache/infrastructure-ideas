This repository houses general ideas and suggestions for future ASF infra services as well as 
enhancements to existing services. 

Have a look in the [Discussions](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-ideas/discussions) tab 
and see if there are ideas your project would want/support, or if there are things you would like 
to add that have not been mentioned yet.

Supporting an existing idea will help the infrastructure team get a better feel for the 
overall organization-wide support for a new idea.
